                “Grilled or panini sandwiches are really popular, but are usually prepared with lots of oils or butter
                to give them a crusty texture,” she says. Instead, just have the bread toasted if you want the flavor of
                a hot sandwich with fewer calories and less fat, Klamer says.</p>

                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 slices of bread (white, whole wheat, or sourdough)</li>
                    <li>2-3 slices of cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or any of your choice)</li>
                    <li>1-2 tbsp butter</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Instructions:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Butter the Bread:</li>
                    <ul>Spread a thin layer of butter on one side of each slice of bread. This will make the sandwich
                        golden and
                        crispy when grilled.</ul>
                    <li>Assemble the Sandwich:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Place the cheese slices between the two slices of bread, with the buttered sides facing out.
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                    <li>Grill the Sandwich:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat.</li>
                        <li>Place the sandwich in the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, pressing gently
                            with a
                            spatula
                            until the bread is golden brown and the cheese has melted.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Serve:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Remove from the skillet, slice in half, and serve hot with tomato ketchup or your favorite
                            dipping
                            sauce.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
